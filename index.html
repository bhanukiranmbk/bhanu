	<p>Gojo's birth placed his family above the other major sorcerer clans thanks to his sheer amount of cursed energy. This gives Gojo lots of political leverage in jujutsu society. The pesky higher-ups can't argue with anything he says, so they often begrudgingly bend the knee to him.</p>

	<p>Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 236 has officially been released, and unfortunately, every fan's favorite character, Gojo, has lost against the King of Curses, Sukuna, leaving fans to wonder how the “Honored One” managed to lose this battle</p>
